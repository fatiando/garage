Changelog
=========

Version 0.5.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/05/20*

New features:

* New processor ``pooch.Decompress`` saves a decompressed version of the downloaded
  file. Supports gzip, lzma/xz, and bzip2 compression. **Note**: Under Python 2.7, lzma
  and bzip2 require the ``backports.lzma`` and ``bz2file`` packages as well. These are
  soft dependencies and not required to use Pooch. See :ref:`install`. (`#78
  <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/78>`__)
* New processor ``pooch.Untar`` unpacks files contained in a downloaded tar archive
  (with or without compression). (`#77 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/77>`__)

Version 0.4.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/05/01*

New features:

* Add customizable downloaders. Delegate file download into separate classes that can be
  passed to ``Pooch.fetch``. Created the ``HTTPDownloader`` class (used by default)
  which can also be used to download files that require authentication/login. (`#66
  <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/66>`__)
* Add post-download processor hooks to ``Pooch.fetch``. Allows users to pass in a
  function that is executed right before returning and can overwrite the file path that
  is returned by ``fetch``. Use this, for example, to perform unpacking/decompression
  operations on larger files that can be time consuming and we only want to do once.
  (`#59 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/59>`__)
* Add the ``Unzip`` post-download processor to extract files from a downloaded zip
  archive. Unpacks files into a directory in the local store and returns a list of all
  unzipped files. (`#72 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/72>`__)
* Make the ``check_version`` function public. It's used internally but will be useful in
  examples that want to download things from the pooch repository. (`#69
  <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/69>`__)

Maintenance:

* Pin sphinx to version 1.8.5. New versions of Sphinx (2.0.*) are messing up the
  numpydoc style docstrings. (`#64 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/64>`__)

Version 0.3.1
-------------

*Released on: 2019/03/28*

Minor patches:

* Add a project logo (`#57 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/57>`__)
* Replace ``http`` with ``https`` in the ``README.rst`` to avoid mixed content warnings
  in some browsers (`#56 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/56>`__)

Version 0.3.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/03/27*

New features:

* Use the ``appdirs`` library to get the cache directory. **Could change the default
  data location on all platforms**. Locations are compatible with the
  `XDG Base Directory Specification <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`__
  (`#45 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/45>`__)
* Add method ``Pooch.is_available`` to check remote file availability
  (`#50 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/50>`__)
* Add ``Pooch.registry_files`` property to get a name of all files in the registry
  (`#42 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/42>`__)
* Make ``Pooch.get_url`` a public method to get the download URL for a given file
  (`#55 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/55>`__)

Maintenance:

* **Drop support for Python 3.5**. Pooch now requires Python >= 3.6.
  (`#52 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/52>`__)
* Add a private method to check if a file is in the registry (`#49 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/49>`__)
* Fix typo in the ``Pooch.load_registry`` docstring (`#41 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/41>`__)

Version 0.1
-----------

*Released on: 2018/08/20*

* Fist release of Pooch. Manages downloading sample data files over HTTP from a server
  and storing them in a local directory. Main features:

  - Download a file only if it's not in the local storage.
  - Check the SHA256 hash to make sure the file is not corrupted or needs updating.
  - If the hash is different from the registry, Pooch will download a new version of
    the file.
  - If the hash still doesn't match, Pooch will raise an exception warning of possible
    data corruption.
