New features:

* New ``pooch.FTPDownloader`` class for downloading files over FTP. Uses the
  standard library ``ftplib``. The appropriate downloader is automatically
  selected by ``pooch.Pooch.fetch`` based on the URL (for anonymous FTP only),
  so no configuration is required.
  If authentication is required, ``pooch.FTPDownloader`` provides the need
  support. Ported from
  `NCAR/aletheia-data <https://github.com/NCAR/aletheia-data>`__ by the author.
  (`#118 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/118>`__)
* Support for file-like objects to ``Pooch.load_registry`` (opened either in
  binary or text mode).
  (`#117 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/117>`__)

Maintenance:

* Testing and official support for Python 3.8.
  (`#113 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/113>`__)
* ðŸš¨ **Drop support for Python 2.7.** ðŸš¨ Remove conditional dependencies and CI
  jobs.
  (`#100 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/100>`__)

Documentation:

* In the tutorial, use ``pkg_resources.resource_stream()`` from setuptools to
  load the ``registry.txt`` file. It's less error-prone than using ``os.path``
  and ``__file__`` and allows the package to work from zip files.
  (`#120 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/120>`__)
* Docstrings formatted to 79 characters (instead of 88) for better rendering in
  Jupyter notebooks and IPython. These displays are limited to 80 chars so the
  longer lines made the docstring unreadable.
  (`#123 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/123>`__)

* Leonardo Uieda

Version 0.5.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/05/20*

New features:

* New processor ``pooch.Decompress`` saves a decompressed version of the downloaded
  file. Supports gzip, lzma/xz, and bzip2 compression. **Note**: Under Python 2.7, lzma
  and bzip2 require the ``backports.lzma`` and ``bz2file`` packages as well. These are
  soft dependencies and not required to use Pooch. See :ref:`install`. (`#78
  <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/78>`__)
* New processor ``pooch.Untar`` unpacks files contained in a downloaded tar archive
  (with or without compression). (`#77 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/77>`__)

This release contains contributions from:

* Matthew Turk
* Leonardo Uieda

Version 0.4.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/05/01*

New features:

* Add customizable downloaders. Delegate file download into separate classes that can be
  passed to ``Pooch.fetch``. Created the ``HTTPDownloader`` class (used by default)
  which can also be used to download files that require authentication/login. (`#66
  <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/66>`__)
* Add post-download processor hooks to ``Pooch.fetch``. Allows users to pass in a
  function that is executed right before returning and can overwrite the file path that
  is returned by ``fetch``. Use this, for example, to perform unpacking/decompression
  operations on larger files that can be time consuming and we only want to do once.
  (`#59 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/59>`__)
* Add the ``Unzip`` post-download processor to extract files from a downloaded zip
  archive. Unpacks files into a directory in the local store and returns a list of all
  unzipped files. (`#72 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/72>`__)
* Make the ``check_version`` function public. It's used internally but will be useful in
  examples that want to download things from the pooch repository. (`#69
  <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/69>`__)

Maintenance:

* Pin sphinx to version 1.8.5. New versions of Sphinx (2.0.*) are messing up the
  numpydoc style docstrings. (`#64 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/64>`__)

This release contains contributions from:

* Santiago Soler
* Leonardo Uieda

Version 0.3.1
-------------

*Released on: 2019/03/28*

Minor patches:

* Add a project logo (`#57 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/57>`__)
* Replace ``http`` with ``https`` in the ``README.rst`` to avoid mixed content warnings
  in some browsers (`#56 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/56>`__)

Version 0.3.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/03/27*

New features:

* Use the ``appdirs`` library to get the cache directory. **Could change the default
  data location on all platforms**. Locations are compatible with the
  `XDG Base Directory Specification <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`__
  (`#45 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/45>`__)
* Add method ``Pooch.is_available`` to check remote file availability
  (`#50 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/50>`__)
* Add ``Pooch.registry_files`` property to get a name of all files in the registry
  (`#42 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/42>`__)
* Make ``Pooch.get_url`` a public method to get the download URL for a given file
  (`#55 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/55>`__)

Maintenance:

* **Drop support for Python 3.5**. Pooch now requires Python >= 3.6.
  (`#52 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/52>`__)
* Add a private method to check if a file is in the registry (`#49 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/49>`__)
* Fix typo in the ``Pooch.load_registry`` docstring (`#41 <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/41>`__)

Version 0.1
-----------

*Released on: 2018/08/20*

* Fist release of Pooch. Manages downloading sample data files over HTTP from a server
  and storing them in a local directory. Main features:

  - Download a file only if it's not in the local storage.
  - Check the SHA256 hash to make sure the file is not corrupted or needs updating.
  - If the hash is different from the registry, Pooch will download a new version of
    the file.
  - If the hash still doesn't match, Pooch will raise an exception warning of possible
    data corruption.
