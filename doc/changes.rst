Version 0.1
-----------

*Released on: 2018/08/20*

* Fist release of Pooch. Manages downloading sample data files over HTTP from a server
  and storing them in a local directory. Main features:

  - Download a file only if it's not in the local storage.
  - Check the SHA256 hash to make sure the file is not corrupted or needs updating.
  - If the hash is different from the registry, Pooch will download a new version of
    the file.
  - If the hash still doesn't match, Pooch will raise an exception warning of possible
    data corruption.
